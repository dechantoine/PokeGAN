# PokeGAN
In this repository, I show my attempt to generate new *Pokémons* using a [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). 
As you can see, the little monsters are satisfying !

But, how did I get those ? Let's see how to manage a DCGAN in few steps !


### 1 - Data

I have downloaded all Pokémons sprites on [veekun.com](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads): the five generations are available, from Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow to Black and White.



### 2 - Design a DCGAN

### 3 - Training

### 4 - Filter
